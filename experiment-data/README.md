# experiment-data
The datasets of DRL-TP

# detail #
Traffic matrix is measured by SDN multi-threaded network measurement mechanism using iperf to send 10-100Mbit flow size. 

# Description #
When the data file exceeds 1000, Github will intercept and display. 
Therefore, in order to better display the data set in this paper, the measured flow matrix is split into two files to display, 
and it should be combined into a file when used.
